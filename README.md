# Beer Consumption Prediction

<p>Beer Consumption Prediction is a project done as a solution for the kaggle competition "Beer Consumption - Sao Paulo" and as a academic project.</p>

## <ins>Goals</ins>

<p>This project was done for academic purposes and aims to predict the amount of beer consumed by Brazilians, from São Paulo, according to the temperature variation.</p>

## <ins>Objectives of the project</ins>

- Understand the Dataset and cleanup unnecessary features (if required).
- Use a Linear Regression model to predict the amount of beer consumed using a a single feature.
- Show technical scores: R2, RMSE, etc.

## <ins>Stractegic Plan of Action</ins>

1. Frame the problem.
2. Get the Data.
3. Data Cleaning (Removal of unnecessary features).
4. Explore the Data.
5. Prepare the Data (Preprocessing and feature selection).
6. Train the ML Algorithm (Linear Regression).
7. Evaluation using technical scores.

## <ins>Technologies</ins>

- Python.
<p>Made on Google Colab.</p>

## <ins>How to use </ins>

- Download the "BeerConsumptionPrediction.ipynb" file on this repository and import it on google colab.
- Download the Dataset at "https://www.kaggle.com/dongeorge/beer-consumption-sao-paulo" and import it on "sample_data" folder on google colab.
- Run it.
